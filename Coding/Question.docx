DAY-1 TASK

Problem-1
You are given a list of daily prices of a stock. You can buy a stock on one day and sell it later on another day after the day you bought the stock. You can perform the above operation only once. What is the maximum loss possible?

Example
Prices=[10,4,2,9]
The greatest loss is incurred when you buy at a price of 10 and sell at a price of 2. Return the difference:9.

Example
Price=[1,2,3,4]
The Price went up every day. Return 0.

Sample Input for Custom Testing
STDIN Function
———– ————–
   7 → Prices [] size n=7
   1 → prices =[1,8,4,2,10,3,2]
   8
   4
   2
  10
   3
   2
Sample Output
  8
Explanation
Using zero-based index notation, the correct answer is a[4]-a[6]=10-2=8. There is a greater difference between 10 and 1 but that would imply selling before buying, and short selling is not allowed in this problem.

Problem-2

Problem Description:
A positive integer d is said to be a factor of another positive integer N if when N is divided by d, the remainder obtained is zero. For example, for number 12, there are 6 factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Every positive integer k has at least two factors, 1 and the number k itself. Given two positive integers N and k, write a program to print the kth largest factor of N.
Input Format: The input is a comma-separated list of positive integer pairs (N, k).
Output Format: The kth highest factor of N. If N does not have k factors, the output should be 1.

Constraints:
1<N<10000000000
1<k<600.
You can assume that N will have no prime factors which are larger than 13.

Example 1
Input: 12,3
Output: 4
Explanation: N is 12, k is 3. The factors of 12 are (1,2,3,4,6,12). The highest factor is 12 and the third largest factor is 4. The output must be 4.

Example 2
Input: 30,9
Output: 1
Explanation: N is 30, k is 9. The factors of 30 are (1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30). There are only 8 factors. As k is more than the number of factors, the output is 1.

Find the homeless 
Problem Statement -:  There are N Homeless people in the community and N houses in the community. It will be given in the array (people), the height of the person, and in the array house capacity of the house is given.
The government decided to give homes to people on the basis of the following conditions:
•	Priority is given to the people from left to right of the array
•	Each person is allotted to a house if and only if the capacity of the house is greater than or equal to the person’s height
•	Nearby empty Houses are allotted to the person( starting from the extreme left)
You need to find the number of homeless people who have not been allotted any home if the government follows the above conditions. So that government will have an idea of how many people they need to allot homes for next time.
Constraints:
•	1 <= N <= 10^3
•	1 <= people[i] <= 10^5
•	1 <= house[i] <= 10^5
Input Format for Custom Testing:
•	The first line contains an integer, N, denoting the number of  people and number of houses.
•	Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 0 <= i <= N) contains an integer describing peoplei.
•	Each line i of the N subsequent lines (where 0 <= i <= N) contains an integer describing housei.
Sample Test Cases
•	Sample Input 1
3  
4
2
7
3
5
10
•	Sample Output 1
0
•	Explanation
people=[4,2,7]
house=[3,5,10]
People[0] has more priority , from left to right order in houses 5 is the nearest one which fits for people[0]
people[1]=2 will fit in 3 which is nearer from left
people[2]=7 will fit in remaining house of capacity of 10
So no homeless people left so return 0 
•	Sample Input 2
3
3
8
5
1
9
4
•	Sample Output 2
2
•	Explanation
people=[3,8,5]
house=[1,9,4]
people[0]=3 can fit in 9 which is nearest from left in array house
people[1]=8  cannot fit in any home which is left (i.e, 1 and 4)
people[2]=5 cannot fit in any home which is left (i.e, 1 and 4)
So return 2,which is number of homeless people

Problem Statement –  Nobel Prize-winning Austrian-Irish physicist Erwin Schrödinger developed a machine and brought as many Christopher Columbus from as many parallel universes as he could. Actually, he was quite amused by the fact that Columbus tried to find India and got America. He planned to dig it further.
Though totally for research purposes, he made a grid of size n X m, and planted some people of America in a position (x,y) [in 1 based indexing of the grid], and then planted you with some of your friends in the (n,m) position of the grid. Now he gathered all the Columbus in 1,1 positions and started a race.
Given the values for n, m, x, y, you have to tell how many different Columbus(s) together will explore you as India for the first time.
Remember, the Columbus who will reach to the people of America, will be thinking that as India and hence wont come further.
Function Description:
Complete the markgame function in the editor below. It has the following parameter(s):
Parameters:
Name	Type	Description
n	Integer	The number of rows in the grid.
m	Integer	The number of columns in the grid.
x	Integer	The American cell’s Row.
y	Integer	The American cell’s Column.
Constraints:
•	1 <= n <= 10^2
•	1 <= m <= 10^2
•	1 <= x <= n
•	1 <= y <= m
Input Format:
•	The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of rows in the grid.
•	The next line contains an integer m, denoting the number of columns in the grid.
•	The next line contains an integer, x, denoting the American cell’s row.
•	The next line contains an integer, y, denoting the American cell’s column.
